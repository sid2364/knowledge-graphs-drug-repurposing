1. How can I learn more about the relationship types in KGs? For e.g., what does gene-corellates-gene mean? pathways-upregulates-gene?
2. What does link prediction actually entail? Does it mean coming up with new relationships/paths/nodes? Can I see this in practice somewhere? Is there code I can go through that does this at a small scale to get an intuition?
3. Potential future work? Finding side effects of proposed drugs? Finding combinations of drugs that "amplify" effect, or don't work well together?
