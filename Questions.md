1. How can I learn more about the relationship types in KGs? For e.g., what does gene-corelates-gene mean? pathways-upregulates-gene?
2. What does link prediction actually entail? Does it mean coming up with new relationships/paths/nodes? Can I see this in practice somewhere? Is there code I can go through that does this at a small scale to get an intuition?
3. Pointers to potential future work? Finding side effects of proposed drugs? Finding combinations of drugs that "amplify" effect, or don't work well together? 
4. 


Pathways - gene 

Structure of report:
Limitations, future work, summaries of techniques. Which methods exist for KGs and KGs for drug repurposing?


1. Which embeddings are used most in practice? Which ones have we (at ULB) used in the past for our research?
2. What do these similarity matrices mean in "2020 Biological applications of knowledge graph embedding models"? Page 9 - how do you read these graphs?


t-distributed stochastic neigbor embedding
PCA - ?

Next steps:
1. Finish overview Latex
2. Go over the KGE paper Inas shared
2. Outline of the prep work/review, narrative, connect diff pieces
    - look at the review paper again for the structure
3. Figure out future work
